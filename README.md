# parcelshop

## Overview

The parcelshop is a fictional microservice for storing and retrieving parcels. Parcels contain for simplicty of the task just a parcel number, a state and an address and a delivery date (YYYYMMDD). There is a pre built REST endpoint for storing new parcels.

## Your Task

Me as a PO want to provide the option to get all parcels that are out for delivery for a given delivery date via a REST endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
I can retrieve all parcels for a specific delivery date AND with a specific delivery state

## Does it work?

Fire up the application and show us how your new endpoint is working. Use a browser,
postman, insomnia or any http client you like or have a look at the test.http file.
